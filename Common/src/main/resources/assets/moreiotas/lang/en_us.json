If it's a list of numbers it'll be 1 by n, if it's a list of vectors it'll be 3 by n, and if it's a list of lists it'll be n by m, where n is the inner list length and m is the outer list length.",

  "hexal.memories.13" : "I wonder what's taking so long to get that new hen house finished? The ones we've had in the past have been so rubbish, it'll be good to finally have one that doesn't leak."
